This is a forked repository from [code4craft](https://github.com/code4craft/webmagic)

It is created for scrape data from a hardware ecommerce website. 

Build a web crawler to find the best sellers products in website https://www.adafruit.com/categories and show these best sellers in a web application.

Tricks: 
The well-seller product: less than 100 units in stock, shown on the page like "70 in stock". 
The common product: more than 100 units in stock, shown on the page just "in stock".
